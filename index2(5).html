			<span id='nr1'>1st Law</span>
				<p>Newton's first law of motion says that a body can't change its initial position untill an external force is applied on it.If body is in rest,it will be in rest or if it is in motion with constant velocity,it wil continue its motion.
					This is also called "Law of Inertia",which was proposed by Gallileo.</p>

			<span id='nr2'>2nd Law</span>
				<p>Newton's second law of motion calculates the quantity of force acting on a particular body.If a body of mass 'M' is moving with constant acceleration 'a' then force 'F' applied on it,<p>F=M.a</p></p>

			<span id='nr3'>3rd Law</span>
				<p>Newton's third law of motion states that "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction."
				 In mathematics<p>F12 = -F21</p></p>
